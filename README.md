Project Overview:
This Java application is designed to manage patient records, providing functionality to add new patients, update existing patient information, delete patients, and display the list of all patients. The application uses a relational database to store and retrieve patient data, ensuring secure and efficient data management.

Key Features:

Patient Information Management:
The application allows users to add new patient records, including details such as name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history.
Users can update existing patient records, modifying any of the stored information as needed.
The application provides the capability to delete patient records, ensuring compliance with data privacy and security requirements.

Database Integration:
The application connects to a relational database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, to store and retrieve patient data.
Database operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting patient records, are implemented using SQL queries and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API.
The application handles database connection management, transaction handling, and error handling to ensure the reliability and integrity of the patient data.

User Interface:
The application provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using a Java UI framework, such as Swing or JavaFX.
The GUI includes various panels and windows for different functionalities, such as the patient list view, patient details entry form, and confirmation dialogs for delete and update operations.
The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly access and manage patient records.
Data Validation and Error Handling:
The application performs input validation to ensure that the data entered by users meets the required criteria, such as valid name formats, phone numbers, and dates.
Appropriate error messages and feedback are provided to the user in case of invalid input or any other issues that may arise during the application's execution.

Reporting and Export:
The application may provide the capability to generate reports, such as a list of all patients or a summary of patient demographics.
Users can export the patient data in various formats, such as CSV or PDF, for further analysis or record-keeping purposes.

Security and Access Control:
The application may implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing only authorized personnel to access and manage patient records.
Appropriate security measures, such as password hashing and role-based access control, are implemented to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the patient data.

Technical Implementation:
The patient records handling Java project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

Java programming language
JDBC for database connectivity and operations
Swing for the graphical user interface
mySQL for database queries and data manipulation
Logging and error handling mechanisms

The application's architecture follows a layered design, separating the user interface, business logic, and data access components, promoting modularity, maintainability, and testability.
